ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Nyle!
I'm currently studying Computer Science at university and loving every minute of it! When I'm not coding, I love to unwind by playing video games, baking delicious treats, and hitting the gym to stay in shape.

ðŸŒ± Learning
Right now, I'm diving deep into the exciting world of Discrete Mathematics, where I'm exploring the fascinating connections between math and computer science.
