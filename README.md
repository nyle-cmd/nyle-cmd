# 👋 Hey there, I'm Nyle!

I'm currently studying Computer Science and loving every minute of it! When I'm not coding, I love to unwind by playing video games, baking delicious treats, and hitting the gym to stay in shape.

## 🌱 Learning

Right now, I'm finishing up my senior electives such as Operating Systems, Formal Methods, Secure Programming, and a bunch of other super interesting stuff!

## 💻 Portfolio

Check out my portfolio to see my latest projects, skills, and interests! I'm always adding new things, so come back often and see what's new.

## 🐾 Cat vs. Dog Classifier

I'm particularly proud of the Cat vs. Dog Classifier I developed using TensorFlow and Keras. This deep learning model can distinguish between cats and dogs with remarkable accuracy. You can check out the project to explore the code, dataset, and see how well it performs on your own pet photos! The Cat vs. Dog Classifier is a testament to my skills in machine learning, image classification, and neural networks. Feel free to take a look and see if your furry friends can stump the model! 🐱🐶
